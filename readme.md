#Binary reader!

A simple, for the time being not operational tool to read files such as logs, databases(to be added), phonebooks and many more.

Works for specific types of files(as the project belongs for a recruiment process).

It reads some .bin files(have to figure out other .bin structures eg an android phonebook), splits the data into headers/records and stores then in txt files in human readable form.

so far Calls.bon is working, soon to finish the rest :)
